        Introduction
    </h1>
    <p>What is Technological innovation for ecosystem and health?
        •	Technological innovation is an extended concept of innovation. While innovation is a rather well-defined concept, it has a broad meaning to many people, and especially numerous understandings in the academic and business world.
        •	Innovation refers to adding extra steps of developing new services and products in the marketplace or in the public that fulfil unaddressed needs or solve problems that were not in the past. Technological Innovation however focuses on the technological aspects of a product or service rather than covering the entire organization business model. It is important to clarify that Innovation is not only driven by technology.
        •	Numerous prospects for enhancing and revolutionising healthcare are presented by health information technology, including lowering human error rates, enhancing clinical outcomes, facilitating care coordination, increasing practise effectiveness, and tracking data over time.
        •	The technology ecosystem creates industrial knowledge that advances technical advancement, and the science ecosystem in this study refers to a system that generates scientific information from basic research. Finally, the business ecosystem creates value propositions and produces products and services.

    <h2>
        Aim
    </h2>
    <p>The aim of a healthcare innovation ecosystem is to both increase the patients' health and well-being while improving the efficiency of the use of potentially scarce resources among members of the ecosystem.</p>
    <h1>
        Objectives
    </h1>
    <p>To find out the technological innovations in the medical    industry.
        In the future of medicine, smart technologies such as smartphone sensors, cloud storage, applications, and data analysis will play an important role in creating digital and innovative health services.
        To find out the technological innovations for the ecosystem.
        An innovation ecosystem refers to a loosely interconnected network of companies and other entities that coevolve capabilities around a shared set of technologies, knowledge, or skills, and work cooperatively and competitively to develop new products and services
        </p>
    <h1>Hypothesis</h1>
    <p>We think that we will find many innovations done for the ecosystem and innovation done to improve human health.
    Especially because the powerful computers being developed at a rapid pace causing the processor hungry calculations required by the tech in energy sector to be satiated.
    And the use of virtual reality to make the students of health sector be more well versed in human anatomy.

    <h1>Methodology</h1>
    <h2>Data collection</h2>
    <p>The most important technologies that have the potential to transform the healthcare industry-
        •	Potential of AI in healthcare- Artificial intelligence has made its way across multiple industries, most importantly in the healthcare sector. In the healthcare industry, AI is extremely helpful for improving efficiency with information processing and decision-making processes. The essential element that strengthens artificial intelligence’s success in healthcare is data.
        •	Remote patient monitoring (RPM) is a type of digital health platform that enables innovation to monitor patient health outside of a traditional clinical setting. RPM is a specific technology which is used to transmit information remotely between patients and healthcare professionals, and it is just one delivery system within the broader healthcare industry.
        •	Technology adoption in data-security – big data in healthcare is expected to reach $34.7 billion by 2022 at a CAGR of 22.07%. As a result, many new age Health tech start-ups are facing a distinct set of challenges to store big data. Therefore, it is essential that the highest level of security and digital protection should be used for data protection. Moreover, the advanced techniques and technologies are revolutionizing healthcare with the use of data and personalised member outreach and engagement.
        The most important technologies that have the potential to transform the ecosystem-
        •	The sources of electricity production such as coal, oil, and natural gas have contributed to one-third of global greenhouse gas emissions. It is essential to raise the standard of living by providing cleaner and more reliable electricity
        •	The National Electricity Plan [NEP] framed by the Ministry of Power (Mop) has developed a 10-year detailed action plan with the objective to provide electricity across the country and has prepared a further plan to ensure that power is supplied to the citizens efficiently and at a reasonable cost. According to the World Resource Institute Report 2017, India is responsible for nearly 6.65% of total global carbon emissions, ranked fourth next to China (26.83%), the USA (14.36%), and the EU (9.66%).
        •	According to a World Energy Council prediction, global electricity demand will peak in 2030.
        •	Close to 74% of the energy demand is supplied by coal and oil. According to a report from the Centre for monitoring Indian economy, the country imported 171 million tons of coal in 2013–2014, 215 million tons in 2014–2015, 207 million tons in 2015–2016, 195 million tons in 2016–2017, and 213 million tons in 2017–2018. Therefore, there is an urgent need to find alternate sources for generating electricity.
        •	It is evident that clean energy is less harmful and often cheaper. India is aiming to attain 175 GW of renewable energy which would consist of 100 GW from solar energy, 10 GW from bio-power, 60 GW from wind power, and 5 GW from small hydropower plants by the year 2022 
        In this way, the country will have a rapid and global transition to renewable energy technologies to achieve sustainable growth and avoid catastrophic climate change. Renewable energy sources play a vital role in securing sustainable energy with lower emissions. It is already accepted that renewable energy technologies might significantly cover the electricity demand and reduce emissions.

    <h1>Observation</h1>
    <p>It is observed that there are a lot of technological innovations for the health sector and for the ecosystem.
        The developments in the technology of the health sector gives rise to increased and better health of human beings. And the development in energy efficiency helps to produce a safer environment
        </p>
    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <p>The conclusion reached is that there has been a lot of technological innovation in a short period of time i.e. 50 years.
        Especially in the 2000s as there has been a rise in the innovations due to very efficient and powerful computers
